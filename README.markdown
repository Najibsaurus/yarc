About YARC
==========

  YARC is an acronym for Yet Another Roman [Numeral] Converter.

  YARC does one thing and does it well: converting numerals from Arabic to
  Roman and vice versa. It has a tiny footprint and an accurate conversion
  engine with decent algorithms.

How YARC Works
==============

  YARC adheres to modern conventions for Roman numerals, with three
  additional variations: IIII for IV (4), XXXX for XL (40), and CCCC
  for CD (400).

  Valid numeral input ranges from 1/I to 4999/MMMMMCMXCIX, due to a
  limitation in the Roman numeral system. Workarounds are unnecessary,
  as large values are seldom used today.
